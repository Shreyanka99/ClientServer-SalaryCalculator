# ClientServer-SalaryCalculator
Program for Connection-Oriented Iterative service in which server calculates the Net-salary of an Employee based on the following details basic salary, DA, IT  sent by the client

Here weÂ use a Python script using sockets to establish communication between the server and client in order to build a connection-oriented iterative service for computing the net income of an employee. In this example, we'll suppose that the client will provide the server with input for the client's base wage, Dearness Allowance, and Income Tax. The server will then calculate the net salary and reply to the client with the results.
